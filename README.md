Brew PHP Cli Switcher
=====================

**I forked this because the original didn't work with linuxbrew, if you're on MacOS, just use the original.**

Brew PHP switcher is a simple script to switch your PHP cli configs quickly between major versions of PHP.

If you support multiple products/projects that are built using either brand new or old legacy PHP functionality and you find it a pain to change config files continually this will make the whole process just one command.

Caveats
-------

For users who have installed PHP via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and for PHP version 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 only.

Installation
--------------

`@todo`

Usage
-----

Where **5.6** exists, please replace with syntax of **5.6**, **7.0**, **7.1**, **7.2**, **7.3**, or **7.4** depending on which version is required.

```sh
./phpswith.sh 5.6
```
